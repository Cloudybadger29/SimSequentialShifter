# SimSequentialShifter
Sim racing is expensive... too expensive...

So why not make a $100+ item myself! This is my sequential shifter. It doesn't have any extra buttons and only shifts up and down, but that's all you need, no?

## Features:
- Custom handle grip and build
- dual spring system to simulate resistance and give a nice feel. It can be adjusted by tightening nuts at the end of each stud.
- Ball spring plungers to provide a tactile feeling as well as keeping shifter in place while not shifting.

## CAD
Held together with m8 and m6 screws, m8 studs, and a m10 stud for the knob. This was my first time doing a pretty CAD-heavy task, so I'm happy with the result

## Wiring
No PCB for this project, as it would just be more work to use. Simple wiring from Arduino to the microcontroller is used instead.

## Firmware/Coding
Im using a tool for  sim racing parts to do the programming for me, called SimHub. It will do everything for me and is fast and easy. Here is a video showing the process
